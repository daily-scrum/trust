Well, we used DeclarativeAuthorization[http://github.com/stffn/declarative_authorization] for a while, but got stuck when it comes to name-spaces and inheritance.
So, we investigated in the possibilities of using CanCan[http://github.com/ryanb/cancan] and CanTango[http://github.com/kristianmandrup/cantango],
and found that CanCan could be slow, because all authorizations has to be loaded on every request.
CanTango has tackled this problem by implementing cashing, but the framework is still evolving and seems fairly complex.
At the same time, CanTango is role focused and not resource focused.
