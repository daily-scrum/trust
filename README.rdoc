= Judge

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.

== Requirements for making this stuff working

Install the gem

    gem install judge
        
=== Setup your controller. 
When a user has been identified you must set the current user. This can be done like this:

    Judge::Authorization.user = current_user
        
To authorize access in your controller, you must have identified the action and the object / class to authorize. If model is nested, then you should also specify parent. You need to find the object or class and this can be done in a before filter. Once you have identified the object instance or class you can call this:

    Judge::Authorization.authorize! action, instance, parent_instance
    
We have however made it really easy for you if you would not like to setup the framework yourself
All you have to do then is to embed this line in your controller after the user has been authenticated:

    judged
