    # Collects information about the current resource and relations.

    # It assumes the name of the resource is built on the controllers name, but this can be overridden in your
    # controller by setting the +model+
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    #    # controller name AccountsController
    #    resource.instance # => @account
    #
    #    # controller name Customer::AccountsController
    #    resource.instance # => @customer_account
