      # * +belongs_to+ - define one or more associations to parents
      # * +actions+ - acion definitions outside the restful actions
      # * +model+ - Redefine the model used in the controller (if it's name does not match the 
      #   controller_path)

      # Enables authorization in controller
      #
      # +trustee+ accepts +:off+ or a hash of +callback+ options such as +:except+ and +:only+
      #
      # +trustee+ automatically calls the class methods: +set_user+, +load_resource+ and +access_control+
      # +trustee+ accepts +:off+ for +set_user+, +load_resource+ and +access_control+ individually
      #
      # +trustee+ will raise an Trust::AccessDenied exception if the user is not permitted the action
      # 
      # ==== Examples
      #
      #   # enable permission check for all restful actions
      #   class AccountsController < ApplicationController
      #     login_required
      #     trustee
      #   end
      #
      #   # disable all permission check
      #   class PasswordController < ApplicationController
      #     # assuming login_required and trustee has been in your application controller
      #     trustee :off
      #   end
      #
      #   # enable permission check and loading for only :new and :create action
      #   class AccountsController < ApplicationController
      #     login_required
      #     trustee :only => [:new, :create]
      #   end
      #
      #   # enable permission check for all restful actions, but without loading resources
      #   class AccountsController < ApplicationController
      #     login_required
      #     trustee :load_resource => :off
      #     model :objects
      #   end
      #
      # ==== Caching Trust::AccessDenied exception
      # Normally an exception handler is included in the ApplicationController. Example:
      #   class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      #     rescue_from Trust::AccessDenied do |exception|
      #       redirect_to root_url, :alert => exception.message
      #     end
