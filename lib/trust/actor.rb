module Trust
  # = Trust::Actor extension
  #
  # Include this module if you want to check if an actor can act upon a specific subject
  #
  # ==== Examples
  #
  #    # If the @actor can create customers, create it
  #    if @actor.can? :create, Customer
  #      Customer.create attributes
  #    end
  #    
  #    # If @actor can create accounts for the given customer, create it
  #    if @actor.can? :create, Account, @customer
  #      Account.create attributes
  #    end
  #    # It is also possible to make code more descripting for the same as above
  #    if @actor.can? :create, Account, :parent => @customer     # or, ...
  #    if @actor.can? :create, Account, :for => @customer
  #
