      # Creates an inheritable attribute with accessors in the singleton class. 
      # 
      # Derived classes inherit the attributes. This is especially helpful with arrays or hashes that 
      # are extended in the inheritance chain. Note that you have to initialize the inheritable attribute.

      # === Example
      #
      #   class Cat
      #     inheritable_attr :drinks
      #     self.drinks = ["Becks"]
      #
      #   class Garfield < Cat
      #     self.drinks << "Fireman's 4"
      #
      # and then, later
      #
      #   Cat.drinks      #=> ["Becks"]
      #   Garfield.drinks #=> ["Becks", "Fireman's 4"]
