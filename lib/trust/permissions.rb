module Trust
  # = Trust Permissions
  #
  # Permissions should be specified in a separate file in you app/model directory. The file could look like this:
  #
  #   module Permissions
  #     class Default < Trust::Permissions
  #       ...
  #     end
  #     ...
  #   end
  #
  # The above is the minimum required definitions that must exist in you file. +Default+ will be used if no classes
  # match the permissions requested, so the +Default+ class definition is mandatory.
  #
  # If you want to separate the permissions into separate files that is ok. Then you shoud place these files in the 
  # /app/model/permissions directory.
  #
  # == Defining permisions
  #
  # The basic rules is to define classes in the Permissions module that matches your models.
  # Here are some examples:
  # * +Project+ should have a matching class +Permissions::Project+
  # * +Account+ should have a matching class +Permissions::Account+
  # * +Account:Credit+ may have a matching class +Permissions::Account::Credit+, but if its inheriting from
  #   +Account+ and no special handling is necessary, it is not necessary to create the permissions class.
  #
  # == Using inheritance
  #
  # Inheritance is also fully supported, but should generally follow your own inheritance model
  # 
  #   module Permissions
  #     class Account < Default
  #       role :admin, :accountant do 
  #         ...
  #       end
  #     end
  #     class Account::Credit < Account
  #       ...
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # == Action aliases
  #
  # You can define aliases for actions. You do this by setting the +action_aliases+ attribute on Trust::Permissions class
  # Example:
  #   Trust::Permissions.action_aliases = {
  #      read: [:index, :show],
  #      create: [:create, :new]
  #      }
  #
  # Keep in mind that all permissions are expanded upon declaration, so when using the +can?+ method you must refer to
  # the actual action and not the alias. The alias will never give a positive permission.
  #
  # == Accessors
  #
  # Accessors that can be used when testing permissions:
  # * +user+ - the user currently logged in
  # * +action+ - the action request from the controller such as :edit, or the action tested from helper or
  #   from the object itself when using +ActiveRecord::can?+ is being used.
  # * +subject+ - the object that is being tested for permissions. This may be a an existing object, a new object
  #   (such as for +:create+ and +:new+ action), or nil if no object has been instantiated.
  # * +parent+ - the parent object if in a nested route, specified by +belongs_to+ in the controller.
  # * +klass+ - the class of involed in the request. It can be a base class or the real class, depending on
  #   your controller design.
  #
  # == Defining your own accessors or instance methods
  #
  # You can easily define your own accessors in the classes. These can be helpful when declaring permissions.
  #
  # === Example:
  #
  #   class Account < Trust::Permissions
  #     role :admin, :accountant do
  #       can :update, :unless => :closed?
  #     end
  #     def closed? 
  #       subject.closed?
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # In the above example closed is testing on the subject to see if it is closed. The permission is referring to 
  # this method when evaluated.
  # Keep in mind that you must refer to the +subject+, as you do not access the inctance of the object directly.
  #

    #

    #   +action+ - action, such as :create, :show, etc. Should not be an alias
    #   +klass+ - the class of the subject.
    #   +subject+ - the subject tested for authorization
    #   +parent+ - the parent object, normally declared through belongs_to
    #
    # See {Trust::Authorization} for more details

    #
    # One example is that you have teams or projects that have members with role and you want to 
    # Authorize against that role instead of any of the roles associated with the user directly
    #
    # === Example:
    #
    #   class Sprint < Trust::Permissions
    #     member_role :scrum_master, can(:update)
    #     def members_role()
    #       @members_role ||= subject.memberships.where(user_id: user.id).first.role_symbol
    #     end

      #   +:if/:unless+ - :symbol or proc that will be called to evaluate an expression
      #   +enforce+ - set to true to enforce the permission, delete any previous grants given from parent classes. Most meaningful in
