module Trust
  class Permissions
    # Permissions should be specified in a separate file in you app/model directory. The file could look like this:
    #
    #   module Permissions
    #     class Default < Trust::Permissions
    #       ...
    #     end
    #     ...
    #   end
    #
    # The above is the minimum required definitions that must exist in you file. <tt>Default</tt> will be used if no classes
    # match the permissions requested, so the <tt>Default</tt> class definition is mandatory.
    #
    # If you want to separate the permissions into separate files that is ok. Then you shoud place these files in the 
    # /app/model/permissions directory.
    #
    # === Defining permisions
    #
    # The basic rules is to define classes in the Permissions module that matches your models.
    # Here are some examples:
    # * <tt>Project</tt> should have a matching class <tt>Permissions::Project</tt>
    # * <tt>Account</tt> should have a matching class <tt>Permissions::Account</tt>
    # * <tt>Account:Credit</tt> may have a matching class <tt>Permissions::Account::Credit</tt>, but if its inheriting from
    #   <tt>Account</tt> and no special handling is necessary, it is not necessary to create the permissions class.
    #
    # === Using inheritance
    #
    # Inheritance is also fully supported, but should generally follow your own inheritance model
    # 
    #   module Permissions
    #     class Account < Default
    #       role :admin, :accountant do 
    #         ...
    #       end
    #     end
    #     class Account::Credit < Account
    #       ...
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # === Action aliases
    #
    # You can define aliases for actions. You do this by setting the <tt>action_aliases</tt> attribute on Trust::Permissions class
    # Example:
    #   Trust::Permissions.action_aliases = {
    #      read: [:index, :show],
    #      create: [:create, :new]
    #      }
    #
    # Keep in mind that all permissions are expanded upon declaration, so when using the <tt>can?</tt> method you must refer to 
    # the actual action and not the alias. The alias will never give a positive permission.
    #
    # === Accessors
    #
    # Accessors that can be used when testing permissions:
    # * <tt>user</tt> - the user currently logged in
    # * <tt>action</tt> - the action request from the controller such as :edit, or the action tested from helper or 
    #   from the object itself when using <tt>ActiveRecord::can?</tt> is being used.
    # * <tt>subject</tt> - the object that is being tested for permissions. This may be nil if there is no object,
    #   such as for +:create+ and +:new+ action.
    # * <tt>parent</tt> - the parent object if in a nested route, specified by +belongs_to+ in the controller.
    # * <tt>klass</tt> - the class of involed in the request. It can be a base class or the real class, depending on
    #   your controller design.
    #
    # === Defining your own accessors or instance methods
    #
    # You can easily define your own accessors in the classes. These can be helpful when declaring permissions.
    # Example:
    #
    #   class Account < Trust::Permissions
    #     role :admin, :accountant do
    #       can :update, :unless => :closed?
    #     end
    #     def closed? 
    #       subject.closed?
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # In the above example closed is tesÂ´ting on the subject to see if it is closed. The permission is referring to 
    # this method when evaluated.
    # Keep in mind that you must refer to the +subject+, as you do not access the inctance of the object directly.
    #
